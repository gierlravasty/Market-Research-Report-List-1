<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gel Barrier</li><li>Solution Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-adhesion barrier market comprises two primary types: gel barriers and solution barriers. Gel barriers are viscous substances that create a physical separative layer during or after surgery, preventing tissue adhesion. They are often biocompatible and can be applied directly to organs or surgical sites. Solution barriers, on the other hand, are liquid formulations designed to coat tissues and maintain separation through absorption into the tissue. Both types aim to reduce post-operative complications and improve patient recovery outcomes.</p></p>
