<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chamfer Milling Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>90 Degree</li><li>60 Degree</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chamfer milling tools are essential in machining for creating angled edges on workpieces. The two primary types are 90-degree and 60-degree chamfer mills. A 90-degree chamfer tool produces a sharp, right-angle edge, ideal for applications requiring precise, flat surfaces. In contrast, the 60-degree chamfer tool creates a more gradual sloping edge, commonly used for aesthetic purposes or to facilitate assembly. Both types contribute to improved part functionality and finish in various manufacturing industries.</p></p>
