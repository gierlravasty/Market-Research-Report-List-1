<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Fiber Membrane Hemodialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membranes</li><li>High Flux Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hollow fiber membrane hemodialyzer market is categorized into two main types: low flux membranes and high flux membranes. Low flux membranes are designed for patients with stable kidney function and remove smaller molecules, primarily urea and creatinine, with a slower blood flow rate. High flux membranes, on the other hand, allow for the removal of larger molecules and solutes, providing a more effective treatment option for patients with more severe renal impairment. This enhances patient outcomes and efficiency in dialysis.</p></p>
